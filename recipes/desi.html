        <li>1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garam masala powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>

        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>A pinch of saffron strands (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fried onions (for garnishing)</li>
        <li>Lemon juice to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><b>Instructions:</b></h4>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Marinate the Chicken:</b>
            In a large bowl, mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt.
            Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and coat well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li><b>Prepare the Rice:</b>

            Rinse the basmati rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30
            minutes, then drain.
            In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the green cardamom pods, cloves, bay leaves, cinnamon
            stick,
            and salt.
            Add the soaked and drained rice to the boiling water and cook until the rice is 70-80% done. The grains
            should be soft but still have a bite to them. Drain the rice and set aside.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li><b>Cook the Chicken:</b>

            In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, heat the oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and fry
            until
            golden brown.
            Add cumin seeds and green chilies. Sauté for a minute.
            Add the chopped tomatoes, coriander powder, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Cook until the
            tomatoes are soft and the oil starts to separate from the masala.
            Add the marinated chicken to the pan and cook on medium heat until the chicken is cooked through and the
            oil
            separates from the gravy. Stir in the garam masala powder.
            Add chopped coriander and mint leaves, and mix well.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li><b>Layer the Biryani:</b>

            In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, layer half of the cooked rice at the bottom.
            Top with the cooked chicken and its masala.
            Add the remaining rice on top of the chicken layer.
            Warm the milk and dissolve the saffron strands in it (if using). Drizzle this saffron milk over the
            rice.
            Sprinkle fried onions and lemon juice on top.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li><b>Dum Cooking (Steam Cooking):</b>

            Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. If the lid is not tight, you can seal the edges with dough to
            ensure
            no steam escapes.
            Place the pot on a low flame and let it cook for about 20-25 minutes. You can also place the pot on a
            griddle (tawa) to prevent direct heat from burning the biryani.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li><b>Serve:</b>

            Once done, gently fluff the rice with a fork to mix the layers without breaking the rice grains.
            Serve hot with raita, salad, and pickle.
        </li>
