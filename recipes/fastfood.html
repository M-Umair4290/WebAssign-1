        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>For Assembly:</b></p>

    <ul>
        <li>4 burger buns, toasted</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>Sliced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Sliced onions (optional)</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise or spicy mayo</li>
        <li>Pickles</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>For Frying:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions:</h4>

    <p><b>1. Marinate the Chicken:</b></p>

    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine buttermilk, hot sauce, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder.</li>
        <li>Add chicken fillets to the marinade, making sure they are fully coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1
            hour (preferably longer, up to overnight).</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>2. Prepare the Coating:</b></p>

    <ol>
        <li>In a shallow dish, combine flour, cornstarch, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder.
            Mix well.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>3. Coat the Chicken:</b></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Remove chicken fillets from the marinade, allowing excess marinade to drip off.</li>
        <li>Dredge each fillet in the seasoned flour mixture, ensuring they are evenly coated. Press the flour mixture
            onto the chicken to adhere well.</li>
        <li>Place the coated fillets on a plate or wire rack and let them rest for about 10-15 minutes. This helps the
            coating to set.</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or a heavy-bottomed pot to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Carefully place the coated chicken fillets into the hot oil, a few at a time, depending on the size of your
            fryer or pot. Do not overcrowd.</li>
        <li>Fry the chicken fillets for about 5-6 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. The
            internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C).</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken fillets from the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess
            oil.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>5. Assemble the Burger:</b></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Toast the burger buns lightly on a griddle or in a toaster.</li>
        <li>Spread mayonnaise or spicy mayo on the bottom half of each bun.</li>

        <li>Close the burger with the top half of the bun.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>6. Serve:</b></p>

    <h4>Fried Chicken</h4>
    <img src="../images/Fried-Chicken.jpg" alt="Fried Chicken" width="320px" height="250px">
    <p>Fried chicken, also known as Southern fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated
        with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. <br>
        The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat.
        Broiler chickens are most commonly used.</p>

    <h4>Recipe:</h4>

    <p><b>Ingredients:</b></p>

    <p><strong>For the Chicken:</strong></p>

        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika (optional, for added color and flavor)</li>
