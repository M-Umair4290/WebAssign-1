    <h4>Pasta</h4>
    <img src="../images/Pasta.webp" alt="Pasta" width="320px" height="250px">
    <p>Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, <br>
        and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking.</p>

    <h4>Recipe:</h4>

    <p><b>Ingredients:</b></p>

    <ul>
        <li>350g (12 oz) spaghetti or other long pasta</li>
        <li>150g (5 oz) pancetta or guanciale, diced (you can also use bacon as a substitute)</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>100g (about 1 cup) grated Pecorino Romano cheese (or Parmesan cheese), plus extra for serving</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt (for pasta water)</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions:</h4>

    <p><b>1. Cook the Pasta:</b></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package
            instructions until al dente (usually about 8-10 minutes).</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>2. Prepare the Sauce:</b></p>

    <ol>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta (or bacon) and
            cook until it becomes crispy and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>3. Make the Carbonara Sauce:</b></p>

    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and a generous amount of freshly ground
            black pepper. Mix until well combined.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>4. Combine Pasta and Sauce:</b></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked al dente, reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>Immediately add the hot drained pasta to the skillet with the cooked pancetta (or bacon). Toss well to
            combine and evenly distribute the pancetta throughout the pasta.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>5. Add the Sauce:</b></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta while tossing continuously. The heat from the
            pasta will cook the eggs, creating a creamy sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, add a little pasta cooking
            water gradually to loosen it up.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>6. Serve:</b></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Divide the Spaghetti Carbonara among serving plates.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with extra grated Pecorino Romano cheese and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped fresh parsley if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately while hot and enjoy your delicious homemade Spaghetti Carbonara!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This recipe serves 4 and can be easily adjusted to suit your taste preferences. It's a comforting and flavorful
        dish that is perfect for a cozy dinner at home. Buon appetito!</p>

    <h4>Lasagna</h4>
    <img src="../images/Lasagna.webp" alt="Lasagna" width="320px" height="250px">
    <p>Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat
        sheets. The same-named Italian dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù,
        béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices.</p>

    <h4>Recipe:</h4>

    <p><b>Ingredients:</b></p>

    <p><b>For the Meat Sauce:</b></p>

        <li>500g (1 lb) ground beef or a mixture of beef and pork</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 carrot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 celery stalk, finely chopped</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>For the Béchamel Sauce:</b></p>

    <ul>
        <li>50g (3.5 tablespoons) butter</li>
        <li>50g (1/3 cup) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>500ml (2 cups) milk</li>
        <li>Pinch of nutmeg</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Other Ingredients:</b></p>

    <ul>
        <li>250g (9 oz) lasagna noodles (about 12 noodles), parboiled according to package instructions</li>
        <li>250g (9 oz) mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>100g (1 cup) Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions:</h4>

    <p><b>1. Prepare the Meat Sauce:</b></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat. Add chopped onions, garlic, carrot, and celery.
            Cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef (or beef/pork mixture) to the skillet. Cook until browned, breaking up any large chunks with
            a spoon.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato paste and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Pour in red wine (if using) and cook for a few minutes until it reduces slightly.</li>
        <li>Add crushed tomatoes, beef or chicken broth, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer
            and cook uncovered for about 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens. Adjust
            seasoning if needed. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>2. Prepare the Béchamel Sauce:</b></p>

    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add flour and whisk continuously for 1-2 minutes to make a roux (a thick paste).</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in milk, a little at a time, until smooth and combined.</li>
        <li>Cook the sauce, stirring constantly, until it thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>3. Assemble the Lasagna:</b></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Arrange a layer of parboiled lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread about one-third of the remaining meat sauce over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Spoon one-third of the béchamel sauce over the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with a handful of shredded mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers: noodles, meat sauce, béchamel sauce, and cheeses. You should have enough ingredients for
            3 layers, ending with a layer of béchamel sauce and cheeses on top.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>4. Bake the Lasagna:</b></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, tenting it slightly to prevent the cheese from sticking.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and continue baking for another 15-20 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>5. Serve:</b></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired.</li>
        <li>Slice into portions and serve hot. Enjoy your delicious homemade Italian Lasagna!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This recipe serves about 8-10 people, making it perfect for family gatherings or potluck dinners. Lasagna also
        reheats well, so leftovers are always a treat!</p>
